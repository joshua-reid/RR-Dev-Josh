					  <p>I am a former construction manager and have over 20 years of experience building, remodeling, and landscaping homes. I am constantly improving my own home, and turned to blogging to help others do the same. I live in Chicago, have two awesome sons, and a wonderful wife. Reach out if you have any questions regarding construction, home improvement, or increasing the value of your home. I would love to help you! <a rel="author" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/103615966897659114186">Click here</a> to connect with Dale on Google+.</p>
